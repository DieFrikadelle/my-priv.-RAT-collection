1.INTRO
Well, this is it, the first release of Optix PRO. It isnt that hard to
use, normal layout:

Server.exe = Server File
Client.exe = Client
Editor.exe = Edit Server Program

To find out exactly how to use a particular part of the program, simply
hover your mouse button over the face of a button, control etc. and a
"help hint" will appear instructing you as to the purpose of that
particular field/button etc.

The Server.exe file is Un-packed so MAKE SURE you pack it before
you run it as it will have a lot smaller file size! We reccommend
the software called "UPX" or "PECompact".
