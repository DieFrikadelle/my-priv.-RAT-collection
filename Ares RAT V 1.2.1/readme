RATs like ares rat are often used by attackers to gain access to and control over infected systems.

It allows attackers to remotely control the infected machine, often using commands to execute various tasks or perform actions as if they were sitting in front of the computer.

Hackers use ares rat and similar Remote Access Trojans (RATs) for various malicious purposes, often centered around gaining access to systems and harvesting valuable information.

Attackers can monitor the victim’s activities, including browsing habits, communications, and other sensitive interactions. This can be used for targeted attacks or to gather intelligence on individuals or organizations.

Once inside a network, ares rat can be used to explore and infect other machines on the same network, expanding the attacker’s control and reach.
The RAT can establish persistence on the infected system by creating entries in the system registry or using other techniques to ensure it starts automatically when the system boots.
