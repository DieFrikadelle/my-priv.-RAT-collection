## **Horus Eyes RAT**


Horus Eyes is a multi-threaded, asynchronous RAT that can automate tasks and save their settings, lock the screen, hide visible windows, desktop icons, taskbar, cursor, swap mouse buttons, lock or unlock the keyboard, empty the Recycle Bin. Also, it can kill, resume and pause processes in Task Manager, create directories, open, delete, and download files.

Furthermore, Horus Eyes can increase, decrease, mute and unmute volume, reboot, shutdown, hibernate, suspend a computer, launch the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), access WiFi passwords, collect passwords and browsing history from more than 35 browsers based on Chromium, inject unmanaged DLL file, ask for privileges, check the User Account Control (UAC) settings, and a couple of other things.

Knowing Horus Eyes's capabilities, it is likely that cybercriminals use this RAT mainly to steal passwords from browsers (and other personal information), and distribute malicious software. It is important to mention that Horus Eyes is distributed alongside a banking Trojan. Cybercriminals use both of them to compromise banking accounts.

Victims of the Horus Eyes are likely to lose control of their computers and access to personal accounts (including banking accounts), suffer monetary loss, become victims of identity theft, have their computers infected with additional malware or other unwanted software (for example, ransomware, cryptocurrency miner), and encounter other serious problems.
